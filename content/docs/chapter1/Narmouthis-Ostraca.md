## Description
Perhaps the largest corpus of Demotic and Greek educational material, this corpus includes 600 entirely Demotic, 350 Demotic-Greek, 70 Greek-Demotic all of which appears to be from a school in Narmouthis.

From the [Trismegistos Overview](https://www.trismegistos.org/arch/archives/pdf/534.pdf):
> The so-called ‘house of the ostraca’ lies against the eastern wall of the temenos of the temple in Medinet Madi (ancient Narmouthis), which was dedicated to the goddess Thermouthis (Rnn.t) and the crocodile god Sokonopis (Sbk-Hʿpy). It has four rooms. In 1938 Achille Vogliano found some 1300 ostraca in room III (ca. 2,5 x 2,5 m), partly kept in two large vessels, partly thrown against the northern wall. The ostraca in the vessels were apparently classified in a systematic way, but this order has unfortunately not been recorded. In room IV, a storehouse for grain, another 250 ostraca were found (P. Narm. 2006, p. 71-73). All these ostraca are now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, where they were labelled OMM 1 to 1555, apparently without distinguishing the two groups. Some ostraca, however, did not receive an inventory number, while others were labelled from I to at least CCLXVI. After some fragments have been joined, the actual number of ostraca found in the house is now 1471, but Italian excavations in 2006 yielded (at least) another 10 ostraca from this archive (P. Narm. 2006 15 till 24). Only about one third of the ostraca have been published (and often republished) in numerous books and articles. Although the archive is bilingual GreekDemotic (and Hieratic), publications are sometimes limited to one language, using the sigla OGN for Greek and ODN for Demotic. All these circumstances make it difficult to get a view on the contents or the composition of the archive.

	- Briefly mentions the Narmouthis Ostraca on page 22, though does not provide much of an investigation since Cribiore's focus is on Greek education.
