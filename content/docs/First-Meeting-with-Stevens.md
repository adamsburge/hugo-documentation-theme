## DPhil Project Initial Thoughts
This is just an initial outline of my thoughts on the DPhil project at the beginning of Michaelmas term 2021.

### The project as it Stands
#### Strengths
- Very marketable. This project has many faces and could easily be geared towards a job post in many subjects
- Nino seems to really like it
- Ambitious. 

#### Weaknesses
- Study design and Methodology are a bit underdeveloped and do not consider available lectures and seminars currently on offer
- Ambitious.
- The Provisional Chapters section is underdeveloped

### Looking Forward
#### Areas I need to look more into
- History of scholarship in:
	- Cross-cultural interaction
		- Adrian Kelley and Christopher Metcalf outline in the introduction to their recent edited volume Classical scholars influence by or interested in scholarship of the ANE before Burkert and West. I should probably familiarise myself more with the full tradition of scholarship on cross-cultural interaction.[^1]
	- Scholarship on education:
		- I should probably read both Henri-Irénée Marrou and Werner Jaeger more thoroughly.
		- Familiarise myself with Egyptian education and the scholarshp around it
			- Early Roman education as well
		- 

#### Skills that I'll need to learn
- Palaeography
- Papyrology
- Languages:
	- Egyptian:
		- Demotic
		- Coptic?
		- Hieroglphics?
	- Sumerian
