## Summary
Due to lexical lists being a large part of the cuneiform education system, Veldhuis’ monograph, while not necessarily compiling a corpus of exemplars, does provide helpful information about the education system of the Late-Babylonian period. Chapter 7, ‘Temples, Scholars, and Students’, will be particularly helpful due to its focus on the Neo- and Late-Babylonian periods.

## Insights into Ancient Education
- Veldhuis outlines the following helpful terms surrounding education
	- [[É-DUB-BA]] (Sumerian) or *bītum ṭuppim* (Akkadian): school house or tablet house.[^1]
	- [[UM-MI-A]] (Sumerian) or *ummānu* (Akkadian): Teacher; master; expert; craftsman.[^2]
	- [[DUMU-É-DUB-BA]] (Sumerian): literally 'son of the tablet house' but used in literary texts to refer to pupils.[^4]
	- [[DUB-SAR-TUR]] (Sumerian): literally 'junior scribe'. Used in [[Colophons]] to refer to a pupil
	- [[ŠEŠ-GAL]] (Sumerian): literally 'elder brother' but used to refer to an advanced pupil.[^3]


### The Aims of Eduba
> This overview of the Old Babylonian curriculum raises the question of the goals of education at the eduba. In the absence of contemporary reflective statements we cannot hope to recover specific information about the educational goals pursued by this programme. What we can do, however, is to compare the programme with the skills needed in scribal practice... The teaching of Sumerian in the Nippur eduba was not guided by the list of skills a future scribe had to master. The lack of attention to Akkadian and the overdose of high-brow Sumerian point in another direction. It seems that handing down the Sumerian language and tradition as completely as possible was considered to be all important. A pupil of the scribal school was introduced to the technique of writing, but more importantly he was introduced to the heritage of Sumerian writing and Sumerian poetics.
