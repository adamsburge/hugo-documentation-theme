 ### Paideia
When considering Werner Jaeger’s _Paideia_ and his contribution to the subject of education in antiquity, both Jaeger’s founding of the movement of ‘third-humanism’ and his elitism (implicit in his third humanism and also demonstrated in his opposition to mass access to higher education) are important since they both seem to have influenced his scholarship.[^1] The former’s influence is evidenced in his optimistic statement at the outset of _Paideia_ that a return to Greek culture could aid Germany’s depleted culture:

It seems, in fact, that the culture of the present cannot impart any value to the original Greek form of culture, but rather needs illumination and transformation by that ideal, in order to establish its true meaning and direction. (Jaeger 1939: xviii)

It is clear, then, that Jaeger’s _Paideia_ is intended, at least in some part, to aid his Third Humanist movement, which advocated an elitist styled education inspired by Platonic ideals whereby the state is more important than the individual.[^2] Another aspect of Jaeger’s approach to scholarship which can be discerned from the quote is his belief in and emphasis on ideals, or timeless realities which can be discovered and applied to any time period. Ernst Badian has shown that, regarding Jaeger’ later writings on Demosthenes, Jaeger’s idealistic view “is supported neither by the details of historical fact (in which Jaeger was not interested) nor by accurate interpretation of Demosthenes' speeches’.[^3] This approach inevitably make _Paideia_ problematic, as Charles Beye points out.[^4] It is Jaeger’s idealism, elitism and his third humanist movement which make him a problematic contributor to the subject of ancient education. These aspects of his scholarship also influenced his popularity in scholarship which, despite his fame in Germany at the start of his career, declined after he immigrated to the US and ultimately became negative after his death.
