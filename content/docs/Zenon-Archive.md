## Dating: Approx. 263-229 BCE
[^2]

## Description
An archive of papyri which relate to [Zenon, Son of Agreophon](Zenon-Son-of-Agreophon.md), and to the day-to-day running of the estate of [Apollonius](Apollonius-(Dioiketes).md). 

Many of the papyri in this archive were found by farmers in the area. Unfortunately, the papyri are split up between several museums. Most of the papyri are in Greek, though 10 are in Demotic and 14 are bi-lingual.[^3]


### Relevance to DPhil Project
While the primary subject matter of the documents in this archive do not relate to education, the relevance of the archive for a project on Hellenistic education is revealed in the palaeography. The handwriting of the documents, mostly in Greek, indicate that they were written by Egyptian scribes who wrote with a brush, as is custom in Egyptian scribal practice, rather than the Greek κάλαμος. This shows that Egyptian scribes had adapted to the Greek script and learned the Greek language by 260 BCE.[^1] 

Additionally, from these documents we can tell that [Apollonius](Apollonius-(Dioiketes).md) was invested in his local Gymnasium.[Citation needed]
