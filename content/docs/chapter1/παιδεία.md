## Lexical Meaning
[TLG](http://stephanus.tlg.uci.edu/lsj/#context=lsj&eid=78989)
1. The rearing of a child.
2. Training and teaching, education, opp. [[τροφή]]

### Thoughts on the 'Opp. to τροφή'
When following up the citations of primary sources supposedly indicated that παιδεία is an opposite of τροφή, I found the sources not very convincing. It certainly seems that the two are distinct, but not necessarily opposite. For example:
> ΣΩ. Οὐκοῦν ἡμῖν τὸ μέν, οἶμαι, δημιουργικόν ἐστι τῆς περὶ τὰ μαθήματα ἐπιστήμης, τὸ δὲ περὶ παιδείαν καὶ τροφήν. ἢ πῶς;
> Soc. Well, then, one part of knowledge is productive, the other has to do with education and support. Is that true?
> – Pl. Phlb. 55d1-3 (Translation by Harold Fowler in the1925 Loeb)
- It seems to me that both παιδεία and τροφή are contributing to acquiring knowledge

## Gathered Definition from Primary Texts
### Literature & Historiography
#### Diodorus Siculus
> καὶ πρώτην μὲν ὑπάρξαι μερίδα τοὺς εὐπατρίδας  
καλουμένους, οἵτινες ὑπῆρχον ἐν παι-  
δείᾳ μάλιστα διατετριφότες καὶ τῆς μεγίστης ἠξιω-  
μένοι τιμῆς παραπλησίως τοῖς κατ’ Αἴγυπτον ἱε-  
ρεῦσι
> the first Athenian class consisted of the "eupatrids," as they were called, being those who were such as had received the best education and were held worthy of the highest honour, as is the case with the priests of Egypt
> – Diod. Sic. 1.28.5 (Translation by Charles Oldfather in 1933 Loeb Volume)
- In this passage, [[Diodorus Siculus]] mentions paideia in reference to the Athenian class 'eupatrids'. The word [[παιδεία]] is given as one of the reasons for why they are considered 'eupatrid' alongside the 'eupatrids' also being apparently 'worthy of the highest honour'. Thus, it seems [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]]'s understanding and use of the word [[παιδεία]] is more linked to nobility, elites, free men, etc.

- Look into Paideia in Diodorus book 2 on philsophia and the chaldeans (uses μαθης word)

#### Dionysius Halicarnassus
> ὑφορῶμαί τινα πρὸς ταῦτα καταδρομὴν ἀνθρώπων τῆς μὲν ἐγκυκλίου παιδείας ἀπείρων, τὸ δὲ ἀγοραῖον τῆς ῥητορικῆς μέρος ὁδοῦ τε καὶ τέχνης χωρὶς ἐπιτηδευόντων, πρὸς οὓς ἀναγκαῖον ἀπολογήσασθαι
> I suspect that certain persons, who have no general education but practise rhetoric on a street-corner level without method or art, will inveigh violently against these statements.
>  Dion. Hal. *Comp* 25.180-183 (Translation by Stephen Usher in 1985 Loeb Volume)

- There are two things that can be discerned about the meaning of [[παιδεία]] ( albeit here it is referring to the 'ἐγκυκλίου παιδείας' and could be different from Diodorus' simple παιδεία) from this passage. 
	- One, not everyone practising rhetoric attained ἐγκυκλίου παιδείας. Therefore, people are learning rhetoric without going through ἐγκυκλίου παιδείας. Dion. Hal.'s comment seems to indicate that education without ἐγκυκλίου παιδείας was viewed as of lesser quality, yet it is an admission that education outside of ἐγκυκλίου παιδείας was happening. The question that arises, then, is what would Dion. Hal. have called this lower form of education? 
	- Two, going through ἐγκυκλίου παιδείας seems to have bestowed upon or given a person some kind of understanding which Dionysius Hal. deemed as higher than other, lower forms of education. Whether this understanding was

## Usage Over Time and Geography
![[παιδεία Time Distribution.png]]

The usage over time is rather surprising. I did not expect the concentration after the [[Hellenistic Period]], particularly in the 4th century CE. 
- Questions:
	- What can be determined by these numbers?
	- Does this reflect any amount of 'looking back' to, say, the Hellenistic or Classical period?
		- Obviously, many of the teachers and scholars [[Late Antiquity]] attempted to make their Greek match [[Attic Greek]]. I need to look more into this and think about this.
