## Notes While Talking
- Look at how *Paideia* is defined and talked about in Greek and Roman sources
	- Same for each culture (Mesopotamia and Egypt)
	- TLG search *paideia*
- Additionally, keep looking into the scholarhip on the topic

- Apprenticeship in Mesopotamian culture can be something higher than scribal (like Egyptian)
	- Fachuasbildung in Gesche

- Add dates into the corpora

- 'Aegean' for Hellenistic era rather than Greece (solves Levant and Anatolia problem)
- Look into Levant education? Just a survey? Backburner

- Graec. B: one off or part of unified thing??
- Is all this unified or diversity?
- How do all of these things connect to each other? Is it part of a unified whole or a diversity?
	- Questions from original proposal are still okay

- Identify and classify different corpora, approaches, etc.
