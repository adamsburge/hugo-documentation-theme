Born in the Greek town [[Kaunos]], [[Caria]] in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], Apollonius lived most of his life in Ptolemaic Egypt. He was the dioiketes, or chief finance manager, of [[Ptolemy II]] and lived in the 3rd century BCE. Apollonius eventually employed his fellow Kaunosian, [[Zenon-Son-of-Agreophon]], to be his personal secretary. 

The documents left behind by [[Zenon-Son-of-Agreophon]] are called the [[Zenon Archive]] and detail the day-to-day running of [[Apollonius (Dioiketes)|Apollonius]]'s estate. From the [[Zenon Archive]] we can tell that [[Apollonius (Dioiketes)|Apollonius]] was invested in his local [[Gymnasium]].
