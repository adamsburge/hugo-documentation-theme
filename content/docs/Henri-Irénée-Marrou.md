## My Opinions

### A Note on Marrou's Scholarship vs. His Work on Education
Marrou is quite well known for his *[[Histoire de l'éducation dans l'Antiquité]]*. Yet, when one looks at his scholarship, the problematic nature of this becomes apparent. Marrou is not a scholar of [[Classical Antiquity]]. He is a scholar of [[Early Christianity]]. Additionally, he is noted as being particularly religious (despite some apparent crises with the Vatican II). The question I have is: can we trust him to not write a 'History of Classical Education' that isn't, in some way, attempting to lead up to Christianity? This will be something very important to keep in mind when I sit down to read his book cover to cover.
